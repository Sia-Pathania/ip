## Quick start

Ensure that Java 25 or later is installed on your computer.

Download or clone the project, then open it in your Java IDE. Alternatively,
run Sage with the project's Gradle run task.

Sage will start and wait for a command. Type a command and press Enter.

Some example commands you can try:

```text
todo return library books
deadline submit assignment /by 25/12/2025 2359
event team meeting /from 25/12/2025 1400 /to 25/12/2025 1530
list
mark 1
bye
```

Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.

## Features

### Notes about the command format

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters supplied by the user.
- `DATE` can be written as `d/M/yyyy` or `yyyy-MM-dd`.
- A date and time can be written as `d/M/yyyy HHmm` or `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.
- `HHmm` uses the 24-hour format and cannot be entered without a date.
- Task numbers are positive integers starting from `1`, referring to the order
  shown by `list`.
- Commands are case-sensitive and should be entered in lowercase.

### Adding a todo: `todo`

Adds a task without a date or time.

**Format:** `todo DESCRIPTION`

**Example:** `todo return library books`

### Adding a deadline: `deadline`

Adds a task that must be completed by a specified date or date and time.

**Format:** `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE [HHmm]`

**Examples:**

```text
deadline submit assignment /by 25/12/2025
deadline submit assignment /by 25/12/2025 2359
```

A deadline must contain exactly one `/by` field. A date-only deadline is due at
the end of that day.

### Adding an event: `event`

Adds a task that occurs between a start and an end date or date and time.

**Format:** `event DESCRIPTION /from DATE [HHmm] /to DATE [HHmm]`

**Example:** `event team meeting /from 25/12/2025 1400 /to 25/12/2025 1530`

An event must contain exactly one `/from` field and one `/to` field. The end
must be later than the start. Date-only boundaries cover the full day.

### Listing all tasks: `list`

Shows all tasks in their current order.

**Format:** `list`

### Finding tasks: `find`

Shows tasks whose descriptions contain the given keyword.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD`

The search is case-sensitive, so `find Books` and `find books` can return
different results.

### Finding tasks on a date: `on`

Shows deadlines and events that occur on a specified date.

**Format:** `on DATE`

An event is shown for every date between its start and end dates, inclusive.

### Finding duplicate tasks: `duplicates`

Reports groups of duplicate tasks.

**Format:** `duplicates`

Duplicate detection ignores case and extra whitespace in descriptions. For
deadlines and events, the date or time range must also match.

### Marking a task as done: `mark`

Marks the specified task as completed.

**Format:** `mark TASK_NUMBER`

**Example:** `mark 1`

### Unmarking a task: `unmark`

Changes a completed task back to not completed.

**Format:** `unmark TASK_NUMBER`

**Example:** `unmark 1`

### Deleting a task: `delete`

Permanently removes the specified task.

**Format:** `delete TASK_NUMBER`

**Example:** `delete 1`

### Exiting the program: `bye`

Exits Sage.

**Format:** `bye`

## Saving the data

Sage automatically saves each successfully added, updated, or deleted task. You
do not need to save manually.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I know which task number to use?**
**A:** Enter `list` first and use the number shown beside the task.

**Q: Can I use a time without a date?**
**A:** No. A time must always be entered together with a date.

**Q: Can I use `25-12-2025` as a date?**
**A:** No. Use `25/12/2025` or `2025-12-25` instead.

## Known issues

- Commands are case-sensitive and must be typed in lowercase.
- A deadline must contain exactly one `/by` field.
- An event must contain exactly one `/from` field and one `/to` field.
- Invalid dates, times, empty descriptions, and incomplete date-time fields are
  rejected.
